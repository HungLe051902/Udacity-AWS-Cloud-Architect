# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Sadly, I can't see any detection in AWS GuardDuty after trying a lot of times. (you can see the brute_force_attack.png picture, I tried trying to brute force attack)

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to AWS Guard Duty documentation page, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC flow logs, DNS logs, EKS audit logs, and EBS volumes
