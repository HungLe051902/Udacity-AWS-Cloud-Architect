Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources
2. CloudTrail is not specified
3. Load-balancer is not configured to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
4. VPC security group allow all ingress and egress traffic
5. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Set IAM policy to readonly
2. Config a CloudTrail that is stored on S3
3. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
4. Limit the traffic on Load Balancer
5. Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging
