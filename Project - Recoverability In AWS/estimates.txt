1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage 
	I think it can take several minutes to a hour to complete
    
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
        I think It takes about 1 hour

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
	I think RPO is 0 because the system failovers to another 
    
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
	This will depend on the replication lag (size of the database, workload levels, ...)
